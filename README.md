# This is a work in progress

Note that this is very much a work in progress. I'm building a tool to help people shop with less plastic packaging, and less packaging in general. I'm doing it in my spare time, although I have very little spare time so I'm cutting a few corners.

Let me know if you have any suggestions or feedback!
